4.2 M.2 Sata interface disabled by default
------------------------------------------

According to the section 2.10 M.2 connectors in QorIQ LS1028A Reference Design
Board Reference Manual(Revision C), the M.2 Key E connector (J18) and this M.2
Key B connector (J20, Sata interface) multiplex the LYNX36 SerDes lane 3. They
can not be enabled at the same time, and the M.2 J18 connector is the default
one from hardware level. So this is why SATA is not validated. Please refer to
the vendor for more information.

4.3 TSN 802.1AS on ENETC not supported
--------------------------------------

According to the LSDK 21.08, the 802.1AS feature is not supported
currently. When you boot two LS1028ardb boards to test it by the following command:
    ptp4l -i eth0 -p /dev/ptp0 -f gPTP.cfg -m
Both sides will show the info of "assuming the grand master role". But this issue does
not affect the other TSN features on ENETC.

4.4 TSN FMI test on ENETC not supported
---------------------------------------

According to the LSDK 21.08, the FMI feature is not supported
currently. When you boot two LS1028ardb boards to test it by the following command:

    tsntool qcifmiset --device eth0 --index 2 --cm --cf --cbs 1500 --cir 5000000 --ebs 1500 --eir 2000000
We can find ""cir":  705032703, "cbs":  1500, "eir":  1999999997," cir and eir are very big value.
But this issue does not affect the other TSN features on ENETC.

4.5 TSN Source Stream Identify Entry test on ENETC not supported
----------------------------------------------------------------

According to the LSDK 21.08, Source Stream Identify Entry test is not supported
currently. When you boot two LS1028ardb boards to test it by the following command:

    tsntool> cbstreamidset --device eth0 --index 3 --sourcemacvid --sourcemac 0x112233445566 --
    sourcetagged 3 --sourcevid 20 --streamhandle 100
    tsntool> qcisfiget --device eth0 --index 1
The frame do not pass. But this issue does not affect the other TSN features on ENETC.
