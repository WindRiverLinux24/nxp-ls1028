  +--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES="'.

Note: The preempt-rt ktype is available for this BSP/Machine at this time.


3. Board Specific Patches
=========================
To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel. For example:

  # cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
  # git whatchanged <kernel_version>/base..<kernel_version>/standard/<bsp_branch>

4. Boot Instructions
====================

The typical u-boot settings apply to these boards. You will need to use
setenv, printenv and saveenv, to configure, display and store respectively
your network configuration details and kernel command line. In order to
TFTP a kernel, you need at a minimum to set the following:

        - ipaddr
        - gatewayip
        - netmask
        - serverip
        - loadaddr
        - dtbfile
        - dtbaddr
        - ethaddr
        - eth1addr

Your board may ship with the values for the MAC address of
the Ethernet interfaces set to the defaults compiled into the
u-boot image.  You should set the ethaddr, eth1addr and so on
as per the manufacturer assigned values, usually indicated with
a sticker on the board.

Target specifics are usually set in the "bootargs" variable, and the
kernel image is set in the "bootfile" variable. Don't forget that if you
want these values to be available after a power cycle you will need to run
the saveenv command.

Typically convenience macros exist that will create a complete bootargs
command line for the kernel based on variables that contain individual
settings.  Since these macros exist as env variables themselves, they
may or may not be present depending on who installed and configured
u-boot for the board.

The console device for the board is ttyS0 at 115200 baud. For the DTB
address, 0xa0000000 was used with success by Wind River. The load address
must be high enough to not interfere with kernel decompression. A value
of 0x80080000 was used with success for all kernels tested by Wind River.


4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Example settings for the monitor (u-boot) are shown below:

nfsboot=setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath \
ip=$ipaddr:$serverip:$gatewayip:$netmask:$hostname:$netdev:off video=video=1920x1080-32@60 \
console=$consoledev,$baudrate $othbootargs;sf probe && sf read $load_addr 0x900000 0x20000; \
hdp load $load_addr 0x2000;tftp $kernel_addr_r $kernelfile; \
tftp $fdt_addr_r $fdtfile;booti $kernel_addr_r - $fdt_addr_r
ethact=enetc#0
kernel_addr_r=0x80080000
fdt_addr_r=a0000000
gatewayip=128.224.165.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=128.224.165.114
serverip=128.224.165.20
netdev=eth0
kernelfile=Image
fdtfile=fsl-ls1028a-rdb.dtb
rootpath=/tftpboot/rootfs
consoledev=ttyS0
baudrate=115200
othbootargs=earlycon=uart8250,mmio,0x21c0500

Note:
  Currently, it seems only SPI nor flash can be the host for bootloader.


5. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create the properly
partitioned image on a SD card. The wic command
generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
User can refer to the below URL to get more WIC details:

http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

This BSP supports disk images for SD card.
After build the project, user will get a WIC image under the directory
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<bsp name>/ ,such as:

tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-ls1028/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-nxp-ls1028.wic

Then user can write the output image to a SD card:

5.1 Burn images to SD card
--------------------------

To burn WIC image to SD card, user only need to execute the below command:

# dd if=wrlinux-image-std-nxp-ls1028.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

5.2 Set uboot env
-----------------

Board can boot automatically by set the below uboot environment variables:

=> setenv bootfile Image; setenv fdtfile fsl-ls1028a-rdb.dtb; setenv loadaddr 0x80080000; setenv fdtaddr a0000000;

=> setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200n8 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw

=> setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 0:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 0:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr'

=> saveenv; run bootcmd;


6. Features
===========

6.1 Audio
---------

The integrated I2S module on LS1028ardb is NXP's Synchronous Audio
Interface(SAI). To enable SAI, the rcw binary should be changed from
default rcw to rcw_1300_audio.rcw, and set EC1_SAI4_5_PMUX to 2. Besides,
run the following command at U-Boot prompt:
    i2c mw 0x66 0x53 0x4
to set BRDCFG3[2] = 1 and set the switch SW5[8] on. Then, the audio will
work normal. There is an audio output port J34 in the front panel of the
board, for testing, you can plug in your earphone to hear the sound by the
following command:

	# aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

6.1.1 Steps to build RCW
------------------------
Since SAI need rcw_1300_audio.rcw, this section describes how to build a
firmware including the rcw_1300_audio.rcw.

Firstly, download the LSDK flexbuilder tool package from the url:
    https://nxp.flexnetoperations.com/control/frse/certdlog?item_key=11696317

Choose the flexbuild_lsdkxxxx.tgz(xxxx means version of lsdk) to download.
After this, build a full firmware for LS1028ardb by command: 
    flex-builder -a arm64 -m ls1028ardb
when build done, set
    EC1_SAI4_5_PMUX=2

in the following file:
    flexbuild_lsdkxxxx/packages/firmware/rcw/ls1028ardb/R_SQPH_0x85be/rcw_1300.rcw

and set rcw_xspi=build/firmware/rcw/ls1028ardb/R_SQPH_0x85be/rcw_1300.bin
in configs/board/ls1028ardb/manifest.

Secondly, clean the last build outcomes of flexbuilder. Then flex-builder
a new full firmware which will include the rcw_1300_audio.rcw. the outcome
firmware should be firmware_ls1028ardb_uboot_xspiboot.img in build/images.
For further use of flex-builder, please refer to 
    flexbuild_lsdkxxxx/docs.

Thirdly, write the firmware_ls1028ardb_uboot_xspiboot.img into xspi flash
on the board at address 0x00 like the following:
    tftp 0xa0000000 tftp-server-patch/firmware_ls1028ardb_uboot_xspiboot.img
    sf probe 0:0
    sf erase 0 +$filesize && sf write 0xa0000000 0 $filesize
    qixis_reset

Finally boot the board. The SAI should work.

6.2 CPU frequency
------------------

CPU frequency scaling allows the clock speed of the CPU to be
changed on the fly.

    # echo userspace > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor

Note: 
    Make sure your expected scaling governors are available from your
    kernel configs

6.3 PTP by ptp4l
----------------

6.6 switch
----------

On the LS1028A SoC, there is a L2Switch which is connected to the host CPU
via two SoC internal MAC-to-MAC port connections between the switch and
corresponding ENETC Ethernet endpoints:

• ENETC Port 2(eth1) and switch port #4(eth7)
• ENETC Port 3(eth2) and switch port #5(eth8)

Following the below steps can bring up the switch ports and test ping between
two boards:

On Board1:
  # ip link add name switch type bridge
  # ip link set switch up
  # ip link set eth3 master switch && ip link set eth3 up
  # ip link set eth4 master switch && ip link set eth4 up
  # ip link set eth5 master switch && ip link set eth5 up

6.7 TSN
-------

6.7.1 Overview
--------------

Time Sensitive Network(TSN) is the IEEE802.1Q defined standard technology
to provide deterministic messaging on standard ethernet and is started
from AVB – Audio/Video Bridging. Currently, LS1028ardb enables the TSN
feature on both ENETC and switch.

For TSN on ENETC, the following protocols have been tested:
    1. IEEE 802.1Qbv
    2. IEEE 802.1Qci
    3. IEEE 802.1Qav

For TSN on switch, the following protocols have been tested:
    1. IEEE 802.1Qbv
    2. IEEE 802.1AS
    3. IEEE 802.1Qci (not include SFI maxSDU)

To get more details about TSN feature, please refer to instructions
mentioned in the sections

    "Time Sensitive Networking (TSN)"

in the NXP's SDK user manual

    "Layerscape Software Development Kit User Guide.pdf (LSDK 20.04)".

6.8 PCIe
---------

The LS1028ARDB has two PCIe interfaces. They are connected to the M.2
connecter with E-Key on the LS1028ARDB Board.

Can choose the below PCIe peripheral to validate:

        Intel Corporation Wireless 7265

Can validate using the following steps:

Simply add line as follows to ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf:

        KERNEL_FEATURES_append = " features/iwlwifi/iwlwifi.scc"

This will include the iwlwifi and mac80211 kernel modules in
the root file system.

Built and install them:

        # bitbake wrlinux-image-xxx

Copy relevant WiFi card firmware (Intel 7265 WiFi firmware: iwlwifi-7265D-10.ucode)
to /lib/firmware of the target image.

Execute the following commands to validate the WiFi cards:

        # ifconfig wlan<idx> up
        # iw wlan<idx> scan
        # iw dev wlan<idx> connect <AP essid>
        # dhclient wlan<idx>
        # ping <AP address> -i wlan<idx> -c 5

6.9 FlexTimer(FTM)
------------------

The FTM is used as the wakeup source to wake up system in deep sleep 
on LS1028ardb. Please following the steps below to test it:

    1> get sleep status to check whether system support deep sleep mode 
    root@nxp-ls1028:~# cat /sys/power/mem_sleep
    s2idle [deep]

    2> set deep sleep mode when suspend to memery, it's optional
    root@nxp-ls1028:~# echo deep > /sys/power/mem_sleep

    3> wake up system in deep sleep mode afer 10 seconds
    echo 0 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc1/wakealarm; \
    echo +10>/sys/class/rtc/rtc1/wakealarm && \
    echo mem > /sys/power/state

    4> the results should be like the followings:
